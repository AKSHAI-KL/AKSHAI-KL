Hi, my name is Akshai Manojkumar. I am 18 and pursuing my Btech Engineering degree in Computer Science and Design from Federal Institute Of Science and Technology.
I'm good at Python and SQL, and that's about it. I just stumbled upon this website to see what all the fuss is about.
Looking forward to learning and growing in the field of Computer Science.
